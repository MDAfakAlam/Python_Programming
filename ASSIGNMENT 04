Q5. Write a Python program that determines the largest of three numbers entered by the user. 
Ans.
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3:
    print(f"The largest number is {num1}")
elif num2 >= num1 and num2 >= num3:
    print(f"The largest number is {num2}")
else:
    print(f"The largest number is {num3}")

Output:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 20
Enter the third number: 15
The largest number is 20
