#PYTHON ASSIGNMENT 01

Q1.Print hello world ?

Ans:- print("Hello World")
        OUTPUT    Hello World

Q2. Describe local variable and global variable code ?

Ans:- In Python, variables can be classified as local or global based on their scope:
Local Variable
A local variable is declared inside a function and can only be accessed within that function.
It exists only during the function's execution.

Global Variable
A global variable is declared outside any function and can be accessed throughout the program,
including inside functions (if not shadowed by a local variable of the same name).

# Global Variable
global_var = "I am global"

def my_function():
    # Local Variable
    local_var = "I am local"
    print(local_var)  # Accessing local variable
    print(global_var)  # Accessing global variable

# Calling the function
my_function()

# Accessing the global variable outside the function
print(global_var)

# Trying to access the local variable outside its scope (this will cause an error)
# print(local_var)


Q3.  Write a code that describe Indentation error ?

Ans:-  CASE(i)
def say_hello():
print("Hello, World!")  # This line is not indented properly
CASE(ii)
def say_hello()
 print("Hello, World!")  # Properly indented


Q4. write a code that describe local and global variable with same name ?
Ans:-
# Global variable
name = "Global Name"

def demonstrate_scope():
    # Local variable with the same name as the global variable
    name = "Local Name"
    print("Inside the function, name is:", name)  # Accesses the local variable

# Call the function
demonstrate_scope()

# Outside the function, the global variable is accessed
print("Outside the function, name is:", name)
 OUTPUT
Inside the function, name is: Local Name
Outside the function, name is: Global Name


Q5. Write a code for string, int and float input ?
Ans:- CODE

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height: "))

# Output the inputs
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}")

OUTPUT
Enter your name: Lucky
Enter your age: 21
Enter your height: 5.6
